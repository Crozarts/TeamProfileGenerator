# TeamProfileGenerator
## Description
Our homework assignment was to build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application had to prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members. This assignment had to also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application creates an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided.
